# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Route Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using dynamic routes and data fetching within the Next.js 15 App Router, specifically in the edge runtime.  The application works correctly during local development but fails upon deployment to Vercel.

## Bug Description

The issue involves fetching data for dynamic routes.  The data fetching mechanism, either through `getServerSideProps` or a similar approach, fails to execute correctly in the Vercel deployment environment, resulting in an error or empty data.  The application functions as expected when run locally.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` (local development).  The application should work correctly.
4. Deploy to Vercel.
5. Observe that the dynamic routes fail to fetch data.

## Expected Behavior

Dynamic routes should fetch and display data correctly, consistent between local and deployment environments.

## Actual Behavior

Dynamic routes fail to fetch data in the deployment environment, leading to errors or missing content.

## Potential Causes

Possible causes include discrepancies in environment variables, misconfigurations related to edge runtime, or unhandled asynchronous operations.
